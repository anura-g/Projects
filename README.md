# Data science/ML projects

Showcasing some of my projects (varying difficulty). In terms of pure machine learning modelling, the vision projects are the most advanced in my opinion. 

Some projects are not uploaded, like my final university project, which involved a lot of machine learning techniques (Star-DCGAN, augmentation etc.) and are available upon request.
