# Data science/ML projects

Showcasing some of my projects. 

The most advanced deep learning work here would be the [memorability project](https://github.com/anura-g/Projects/tree/master/Computer%20Vision/Memorability%20Project) that I submitted as my university final year project.

For seeing my ability to extract meaningful information from data, the [eSports project](https://github.com/anura-g/Projects/tree/master/eSports%20Analysis) would be good to have a look at.

The datasets used are a mix of Kaggle, my own, and other websites. I like to collect my own data through APIs when I think it will improve the quality of the project.  

Each project has the tech stack stated, but I've summarised it here:

**Tech stack** = [Python, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Pytorch, Tensorflow, Statsmodels, DEAP]
