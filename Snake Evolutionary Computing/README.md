# Snake NeuroEvolution

A snake game coded from scratch with a neuroevolutionary agent that aims to maximise the snakes score.  

This involves a neural network (coded from scratch) and evolutionary algorithm that uses my custom techniques to maximise the score.

Please read my report if you are interested in knowing the full details. It is a very complicated project so I explain the motivation 
from literature, and show visualisations of whats happening in the report.

Tech stack = [Python, DEAP, Matplotlib, Numpy]

# Motivation 

I used a Nokia 150 for many years and have played Snake many timess. I also am very interested in new methods
for machine learning, which can go beyond simple statistical-based approaches. This project allowed me to combine
these passions.
