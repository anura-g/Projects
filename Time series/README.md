# About

The work here is there to demonstrate my ability to use finance APIs to get my own data and analyse it using time series models.

I have uploaded the dashboard and it can be viewed here: https://www.myexplanations.xyz 


# Motivation
I have been interested in blockchain technology for many years now and have spent a lot of time understanding the technical details of what it constitutes: hashing algorithms, elliptic curve mathematics, locking mechanics etc. In pursuit of this knowledge, I emerged myself in its ecosystem and started trading some BTC a while back. That's where the idea for these projects spawned.
