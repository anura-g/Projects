# Motivation 

I have been interested in blockchain technology for many years now and have spent a lot of time understanding the technical details of what
it constitutes: hashing algorithms, elliptic curve mathematics, locking mechanics etc. In pursuit of this knowledge, I emerged myself in its 
ecosystem and started trading some BTC a while back. That's where the idea for this project came from. Of course, this is just 1 model and it
almost certainly won't make you any money in the long run. It was done purely out of interest and for learning purposes.
