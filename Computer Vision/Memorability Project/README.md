# About
 
 This was my 3rd year CompSci final year project. It is a research project based on Dr Adrian Bors' idea for a [visual memory schema](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.02056.pdf) (VMS). 
 I take a lot of pride in this project as the work here was continued and went on to be [published](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-05623-y). 
 
 You can imagine a VMS to be similar to a heatmap of the 'interesting' elements in an image. For example, in a picture of a playground, the VMS would highlight the colourful
 ferris wheel. These VMS are created by humans and were stored in a dataset of about 2,000 (image, VMS) pairs. I suggested that we use a variation of a special type of GAN capable 
 of image translation (Pix2Pix-GAN) to generate fake VMS for a completely new image and compare it to what a human would identify as 'interesting'. The project was succesful and 
 many of the suggestions at the end of my report have been implemented in Dr. Bors' public research papers.
