# About

This is by far my biggest strength. For my final year project, I decided to use a custom **General Adversarial Network (GAN)** to generate the schema
for interesting images. For this pursuit, I had to learn a lot about images, convolutional neural networks and eventually GANs. I read a lot of the 
research in this field and was in e-mail groups with many researchers discussing how this field can be pushed further.

The **memorability project** is my most advanced project in terms of machine learning, and the report presented is a good example of how I communicate
my ideas through writing. 

I would also recommend checking out [DCGAN_FACES_50](https://github.com/anura-g/Projects/blob/master/Computer%20Vision/GANs/DCGAN_FACES_50.ipynb) where 
I used a custom dataset (scraped from Facebook) of club photos (local to my university) to generate new photos that look very realistic but are 
actually completely fake. The generated photos show outlines of (fake) people, (fake) club logos and even have accurate lighting conditions.  

**Tech stack** = [Python, Pytorch, Numpy]
