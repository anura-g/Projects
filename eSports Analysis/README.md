# About

This project was about analysing regional competitive data for League of Legends (LoL) and ranked data to create a picture of what leads
to match victories. I use these strategies for my personal predictions (sometimes betting). 

Important to note that the game is very multifaceted and although this is a multivariate analysis, it cannot capture everything. The scene
is yet to mature and so accurate predictions through data modelling is unlikely. There is a lot of hidden data (i.e. private scrim results) 
that would be useful but is not available for competetive reasons. 

**Tech stack** = [Python, Pandas, Riot_API, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Seaborn]

# Motivation

I have played LoL for many years, managing to play competitively for my university and reaching the top 1% of the playerbase. I have also
been betting on games on occasions since I follow the scene very closely and have a good understanding of western team dynamics. Predictions
mostly come from understanding very specific game information and even the game itself can be very stochastic. The models provided aim to
understand the regional dynamics of the competitive scene and capture some useful in-game decisions that can lead to victories.
